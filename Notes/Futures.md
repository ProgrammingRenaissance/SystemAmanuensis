# The Future of System Amanuensis

This document looks at the possible future for the System Amunuensis product.

This product will support the underlying structure of the
Programming Renaissance organization as well as its products.
Obviously, System Amanuensis will support itself.

## Goals

## Construction

### Long-Term

### Short-Term

A primary early objective for
<abbr title="System Amanuensis">SA</abbr> is to be able to
completely control the construction and maintenance of a new
computer. This will include, but not be limited to supporting
<abbr title="Programming Renaissance">PR</abbr> objectives. All the underlying functionality needed to implement this goal will also be
needed to be implemented.

The initial version will concentrate on doing things. Later versions
will concentrate on controlling things.
